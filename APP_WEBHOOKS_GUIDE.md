# App Webhooks Guide

## Overview

The App Webhooks feature allows you to receive HTTP notifications when specific application events occur. This includes both dedicated app webhook events and enhanced data for individual forwarding rules.

## Available Webhook Events

### 1. Application Started Manually
- **Event**: `app_manual_start`
- **Triggered**: When the user opens the app by tapping the app icon
- **Use Case**: Track when users actively engage with the app

### 2. Application Auto-Started
- **Event**: `app_auto_start`
- **Triggered**: When the app starts automatically (e.g., after device boot, service restart)
- **Use Case**: Monitor background service reliability and auto-start functionality

### 3. SIM Network Status Changed
- **Event**: `sim_status_changed`
- **Triggered**: When the SIM card status changes (inserted, removed, ready, locked, etc.)
- **Use Case**: Track SIM card availability and network connectivity

### 4. Enhanced Forwarding Rules
- **Events**: `sms_received`, `call_received`, `push_notification_received`
- **Triggered**: When SMS messages, calls, or push notifications are received (if enhanced data is enabled per rule)
- **Use Case**: Get comprehensive device and network information with each forwarded message

## Enhanced Data Configuration

The app provides two levels of enhanced data configuration:

### 1. App Webhooks (Global Settings)
Configure enhanced data for dedicated app webhook events (app start, SIM status changes) in Settings â†’ App Webhooks.

### 2. Per-Rule Enhanced Data (Individual Forwarding Rules)
Each forwarding rule can have its own enhanced data configuration, providing granular control over what information to include with each specific webhook.

## Per-Rule Enhanced Data Configuration

When creating or editing a forwarding rule, you can configure enhanced data options specifically for that rule:

### Configuration Options

1. **Enable Enhanced Data**: Master switch to enable enhanced data for this rule
2. **Device Information**: Model, manufacturer, Android version, device name
3. **SIM Information**: Operator details, network type, dual SIM support, phone numbers
4. **Network Information**: WiFi details, IP addresses, connectivity status, roaming
5. **App Configuration**: Service status, rules count, permissions, webhook status

### Benefits of Per-Rule Configuration

- **Granular Control**: Different rules can include different types of enhanced data
- **Performance Optimization**: Only collect needed data for each specific use case
- **Privacy Control**: Sensitive information can be limited to specific rules
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Reduce payload size by including only relevant data
- **Use Case Optimization**: Tailor data collection to specific integration needs

## Testing Webhooks

1. Configure your webhook URLs
2. Enable desired enhanced data options
3. Tap **Test Webhooks** to send test payloads
4. Check your webhook endpoint to verify receipt
5. Test payloads will have event names prefixed with `test_`

## Privacy and Security Considerations

- **Enhanced data is optional**: You can disable any enhanced data collection
- **Local processing**: All data is collected locally and only sent to your configured webhooks
- **Permission-based**: Only data accessible with granted permissions is collected
- **No external services**: No data is sent to third-party analytics or tracking services
- **User control**: You have complete control over what data is included

### Security Best Practices

- Always use HTTPS URLs for production webhooks
- Implement authentication on your webhook endpoints
- Validate the payload structure and timestamp
- Consider implementing request signing for additional security
- Regularly review and audit webhook configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Webhooks Not Firing

1. Ensure the webhook is enabled (switch is on)
2. Verify the URL is correct and accessible
3. Check that the app has internet permission
4. Review device logs for error messages

### Missing Enhanced Data

1. Check that enhanced data options are enabled
2. Verify required permissions are granted
3. Some data may not be available on all devices
4. Check the Settings page for permission status

### Network Errors

- The app uses a 30-second timeout for webhook requests
- Failed webhooks are not retried automatically
- Check your server logs for incoming requests
- Verify SSL certificates for HTTPS endpoints

### SIM Status Not Updating

- Ensure the app has Phone State permission
- Some devices may not report all SIM state changes
- Try removing and reinserting the SIM card to test

## Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use secure connections for webhooks
2. **Handle Failures**: Your webhook endpoint should return 2xx status codes
3. **Process Asynchronously**: Don't block on webhook processing
4. **Monitor Reliability**: Track webhook delivery success rates
5. **Validate Timestamps**: Check that timestamps are recent to prevent replay attacks
6. **Selective Data**: Only enable enhanced data options you actually need
7. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review webhook configurations and data usage

## Example Webhook Server (Node.js)

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const { event, timestamp, device_id, message, data } = req.body;
  
  console.log(`Received ${event} from ${device_id} at ${new Date(timestamp)}`);
  console.log(`Message: ${message}`);
  
  // Handle different event types
  switch(event) {
    case 'sms_received':
      console.log(`SMS from ${data.from}: ${data.text}`);
      break;
    case 'call_received':
      console.log(`Call from ${data.from} (${data.contact})`);
      break;
    case 'push_notification_received':
      console.log(`Notification from ${data.package}: ${data.title}`);
      break;
    case 'app_manual_start':
    case 'app_auto_start':
      console.log(`App started: ${event}`);
      break;
    case 'sim_status_changed':
      console.log(`SIM status: ${data.sim_status}`);
      break;
  }
  
  // Process enhanced device info if available
  if (data.device_info) {
    const deviceInfo = data.device_info;
    console.log(`Device: ${deviceInfo.device_manufacturer} ${deviceInfo.device_model}`);
    
    if (deviceInfo.sim_info) {
      console.log(`SIM: ${deviceInfo.sim_info.sim_operator} (${deviceInfo.sim_info.sim_state})`);
    }
    
    if (deviceInfo.network_info) {
      console.log(`Network: ${deviceInfo.network_info.connection_type}`);
      if (deviceInfo.network_info.wifi_info) {
        console.log(`WiFi: ${deviceInfo.network_info.wifi_info.ssid}`);
      }
    }
    
    if (deviceInfo.app_config) {
      console.log(`App: v${deviceInfo.app_config.version_name} (${deviceInfo.app_config.forwarding_rules_count} rules)`);
    }
  }
  
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server listening on port 3000');
});
```
