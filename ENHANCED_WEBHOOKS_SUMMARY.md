# Enhanced Webhooks Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented per-rule enhanced webhook functionality for SMS, calls, and push notifications. Each individual forwarding rule can now have its own enhanced data configuration, providing granular control over what device information to include with each specific webhook.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Per-Rule Enhanced Data Configuration
- **Individual Rule Control**: Each forwarding rule has its own enhanced data settings
- **Granular Configuration**: Users can select different enhanced data types for each rule
- **Master Switch**: Enable/disable enhanced data per rule with a master switch
- **Selective Data Types**: Choose from device info, SIM info, network info, and app config per rule

### 2. Enhanced Data Configuration UI

#### ForwardingRuleEditActivity
- Added Enhanced Data Configuration section to rule editing UI
- Master switch to enable/disable enhanced data for the rule
- Individual switches for each data type:
  - Device Information (model, manufacturer, Android version)
  - SIM Information (operator, network type, dual SIM details)
  - Network Information (WiFi details, IP addresses, connectivity)
  - App Configuration (service status, rules count, permissions)

#### ForwardingConfig.java
- Added enhanced data configuration fields to ForwardingConfig class
- `enhancedDataEnabled` - Master switch for enhanced data
- `includeDeviceInfo` - Include device information
- `includeSimInfo` - Include SIM information
- `includeNetworkInfo` - Include network information
- `includeAppConfig` - Include app configuration
- Updated save/load methods to persist enhanced data preferences

### 3. Per-Rule Enhanced Message Preparation

#### Enhanced Methods
- `prepareEnhancedMessage()` - Enhanced SMS webhooks using rule-specific configuration
- `prepareEnhancedNotificationMessage()` - Enhanced push notification webhooks
- `prepareEnhancedCallMessage()` - Enhanced call webhooks
- `addEnhancedDeviceInfoForRule()` - Device info filtering based on rule preferences

#### Updated Components
- **SmsBroadcastReceiver**: Uses per-rule enhanced SMS message preparation
- **NotificationListenerService**: Uses per-rule enhanced notification message preparation  
- **CallWebhookWorker**: Uses per-rule enhanced call message preparation
- **ForwardingConfigDialog**: Test webhooks use per-rule enhanced payloads

### 4. Two-Level Enhanced Data System

#### App Webhooks (Global Settings)
- Configure enhanced data for dedicated app webhook events
- App start events (manual/auto) use global enhanced data configuration
- SIM status change events use global enhanced data configuration

#### Per-Rule Enhanced Data (Individual Rules)
- Each forwarding rule has independent enhanced data configuration
- SMS, call, and push notification rules use their own enhanced data settings
- Granular control over what data to include for each specific use case

### 5. Enhanced Payload Structure

Per-rule enhanced webhooks use a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "event": "sms_received|call_received|push_notification_received",
  "timestamp": 1701234567890,
  "device_id": "Device Model",
  "message": "Human-readable description",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data (from, text, contact, etc.)
    "device_info": {
      // Filtered device information based on rule preferences
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Granular Control**: Each rule can have different enhanced data requirements
2. **Performance Optimization**: Only collect needed data for each specific rule
3. **Privacy Control**: Sensitive information can be limited to specific rules
4. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Reduce payload size by including only relevant data
5. **Use Case Optimization**: Tailor data collection to specific integration needs

### Configuration Storage

- Enhanced data preferences stored per rule in SharedPreferences
- JSON serialization includes enhanced data configuration fields
- Backward compatibility with existing rules (defaults to disabled)
- Automatic migration of existing rules to new configuration format

### Data Collection Logic

- Enhanced data only collected when rule has `enhancedDataEnabled = true`
- Device information filtered based on individual rule preferences
- Graceful fallback to original template format if enhanced data fails
- Error handling prevents enhanced data issues from breaking webhooks

## User Experience

### Configuration Flow
1. Create or edit a forwarding rule
2. Configure basic rule settings (activity type, sources, webhook URL)
3. In Enhanced Data Configuration section:
   - Enable enhanced data with master switch
   - Select specific data types to include
4. Save rule with enhanced data preferences
5. Rule automatically uses enhanced payloads when triggered

### Benefits for Users

- **Flexibility**: Different rules can have different enhanced data requirements
- **Privacy**: Sensitive data can be limited to specific trusted endpoints
- **Performance**: Reduce bandwidth by only including needed data
- **Use Case Optimization**: Tailor data collection to specific integration needs
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing rules continue to work unchanged

## Enhanced Data Categories

### Device Information
- Device model, manufacturer, brand, product
- Android version and SDK level
- Device name from system settings

### SIM Information
- SIM state and operator details
- Network country and type information
- Dual SIM support with slot information
- Phone numbers (if available and permitted)

### Network Information
- Connection status and type
- WiFi details (SSID, signal strength, frequency)
- IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6) with interface information
- Roaming status and connectivity details

### App Configuration
- Service running status and start count
- Number of forwarding rules configured
- Webhook configuration status
- Permission status for all app permissions

## Security & Privacy

### Privacy Controls
- **Per-Rule Configuration**: Enhanced data is configurable per individual rule
- **Granular Control**: Users choose exactly what data to include for each rule
- **Local Processing**: All data collected locally, no external services
- **Permission-Based**: Only accessible data is collected
- **Selective Sharing**: Sensitive data can be limited to trusted endpoints

### Security Features
- **HTTPS Support**: SSL/TLS encryption for webhook endpoints
- **Custom SSL Factory**: Support for custom SSL configurations
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without data leakage
- **Timeout Management**: 30-second timeout prevents hanging requests
- **Fallback Protection**: Graceful fallback to original templates on errors

## Documentation Updates

- Added per-rule enhanced data configuration section
- Explained two-level enhanced data system (global vs per-rule)
- Updated payload examples for per-rule configuration
- Enhanced configuration instructions for both levels
- Updated Node.js webhook server example

2. **Data Validation**: Validate enhanced data before including in payloads
3. **Conditional Logic**: Include enhanced data based on conditions
4. **Data Caching**: Cache device information to improve performance
5. **Enhanced Data Analytics**: Track enhanced data usage and performance
